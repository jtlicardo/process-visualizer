The process starts with the curator selecting the artwork to be featured in the exhibition. He then arranges the artwork in the gallery space according to his vision. The gallery staff hang the artwork on the walls and set up any additional displays. The curator then reviews the setup and makes any necessary adjustments. The marketing team creates promotional materials for the exhibition and distributes them to potential visitors. The gallery staff then open the doors to the public and welcome visitors to the exhibition. The process is complete.
