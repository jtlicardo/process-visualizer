The first step is for the student to register for the exam through the university's online portal. Once registered, he will receive an email confirming their registration. Next, he will need to arrive at the exam location on the day of the exam. Before entering the exam room, the student will be required to check in with an exam administrator. Once inside the exam room, the student will take the exam. Once the exam time is up, the student will need to submit their completed exam. He will then be allowed to leave the exam room. After the exam, the professor will grade the exams. The students will receive their exam results at a later date.
